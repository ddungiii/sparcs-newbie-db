# SPARCS Newbie Seminar - DB
Demo code for the database session of the 2021 spring SPARCS newbie seminar.

Slides will be avaliable on [our website](https://sparcs.org/seminars).

## Running the project
Open two terminals and run the frontend and backend on each terminal.
```bash
cd backend
npm install # Only for the first time
npm start
```
```bash
cd frontend
npm install # Only for the first time
npm start
```

Note that the frontend supports HMR (ie. changes in code is applied without refreshing),
but the backend needs a full restart (CTRL+C then `npm start`)
